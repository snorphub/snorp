        <p>So, if you have access to this site then you probably know why. Here's the thing. It's close to impossible to<br>
    make a forum out of CSS and HTML. So, for now, we're going to have to just stick with this as our site. I'll post the sheet<br>
    music for everybody. I'll also use this site to post about yeah I don't know. I'll find a way for all of us to use it. In the<br>
    meantime, we'll just use this to learn the new music we'd like to play. Feel free to explore.</p>
